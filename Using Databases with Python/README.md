# Using Databases with Python

This repository contains programs created during the completion of the **Using Databases with Python** course from the University of Michigan. The programs include sample scripts, assignments, database files, and additional programs written while exploring course concepts.

## Overview of Programs

1. **FirstClassProgram.py** - A basic program demonstrating initial database interaction.
2. **parsingemailandaddtothedatabase.py** - Parses email data and adds it to a database.
3. **Parsingemailmbox.py** - Extracts emails from an mbox file and processes them.
4. **Programforobjectlifecycle.py** - Demonstrates object lifecycle concepts in Python.
5. **UsingInheritance.py** - Explores object-oriented programming using inheritance.
6. **rosterassign.py** - Manages student roster assignments using databases.
7. **roster.py** - A script for handling student roster data.
8. **geodump.py** - Extracts geographic data from a database.
9. **geoload.py** - Loads geographic data into a database.
10. **tracks.py** - Processes and organizes track information from a dataset.

## Database Files

- **emaildb.sqlite** - Database storing parsed email data.
- **geodata.sqlite** - Database for storing geographic information.
- **rosterdb.sqlite** - Database managing student roster assignments.
- **trackdb.sqlite** - Database storing track and music data.

## Additional Data Files

- **roster_data.json, roster_data_sample.json, roster_data_small.json** - JSON data files for roster processing.
- **tracks.csv** - CSV file containing track data.
- **Library.xml** - XML file containing library data.
- **where.data, where.html, where.js** - Files related to geographic data processing.

This repository serves as a reference for working with databases in Python and exploring data management techniques using SQLite.
