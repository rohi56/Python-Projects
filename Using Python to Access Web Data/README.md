25. **UsingAPIproxyfromopengeo.py** - Uses an API proxy from OpenGeo.
26. **usingparsingxml.py** - Parses XML data.
27. **Usingre.py** - Demonstrates regular expressions in Python.
28. **Usingrelikestartswith.py** - Uses regex to check string prefixes.
29. **Usingurlliblibrarytoread.py** - Reads web data using `urllib`.
30. **XMLhavemultipletags.py** - Handles XML data with multiple tags.
31. **yheregexversion.py** - Another regex demonstration script.

## Notes
- These scripts were created while exploring different aspects of web data access and parsing.
- Some scripts are assignments, while others were written for practice and experimentation.
- You may need to install additional libraries depending on the script requirements.

## How to Use
Simply run the Python scripts using:
```bash
python script_name.py
```
Ensure you have the necessary dependencies installed before running API or web-based scripts.
