📝 Text Analyzer
A simple Python-based text analysis project implemented in a Jupyter Notebook. This project introduces the fundamental concepts of text mining and demonstrates how to analyze and extract meaningful insights from textual data.

📌 What is Text Analysis?
Text analysis (also known as text mining or text analytics) refers to the process of extracting meaningful information from text. It can involve tasks such as word frequency counting, sentiment analysis, topic modeling, and more.

🎯 Objectives
After completing this project, you will be able to:

Use Python to perform basic text analysis.

Convert text to lowercase.

Identify and count the frequency of all unique words.

Find the frequency of a specific word in a given string.

Build a reusable Python class to encapsulate these operations.

🛠️ Features
A TextAnalyzer class that:

Accepts a string of text as input.

Normalizes the text (e.g., lowercasing and removing punctuation).

Calculates word frequency.

Returns the frequency of a specific word.
