# Python Data Structures Practice

This repository contains various Python programs created as part of the "Python Data Structures" course from the University of Michigan. The files include assignments, practice problems, and additional programs inspired by the course content.

## File Descriptions

### Assignments
- **assignment_1.py**: Basic assignment to practice string manipulation.
- **assignment6.py**: Work with lists and their operations.
- **assignment7_1.py** & **assignment7_2.py**: Exploring dictionaries and their usage.
- **assignment8_4.py** & **assignment8_5.py**: File handling exercises, including reading and processing data.
- **assignment9_4.py**: Advanced dictionary usage and counting patterns.
- **assignment10_2.py**: Combining file handling with string operations.

### Practice Programs
- **animal.py**: Simple program to explore string operations.
- **appendingalistunsingwhile.py**: Demonstrates appending to a list using a `while` loop.
- **buildinglistfromscratch.py**: Creating and populating lists dynamically.
- **countinglinesfromfile.py**: Counts the number of lines in a file.
- **CountingandreadingtheLine.py**: Reads and counts lines in a file with additional functionality.
- **DictionariesLiteralsCoanstant.py**: Practice with dictionary literals and constants.
- **HandlingBadFileName.py**: Handles errors gracefully when a file is not found.
- **lowerupper.py**: Demonstrates string methods for case conversion.
- **searchingastring.py**: Searches for substrings within a string.
- **splitandcount.py**: Splits a string and counts the occurrences of each word.
- **Sortinglistsoftuples.py**: Demonstrates sorting techniques for lists of tuples.
- **Thetop10mostcommonwords.py**: Finds and displays the top 10 most common words in a file.

### Other Notable Files
- **mbox.txt**, **mbox-short.txt**, **names.txt**, **para.txt**, **romeo.txt**, **words.txt**: Text files used for practice with file handling and text processing.
- **example.py**: General example program for learning.
- **nwline.py**: Illustrates handling newline characters in text.
- **Slicing Strings.py**: Demonstrates string slicing techniques.

## Notes

- These programs are primarily for educational purposes and may not handle all edge cases.
- Some programs require input files (e.g., `mbox.txt`, `romeo.txt`). Ensure these files are in the same directory as the script when running.

Feel free to explore, modify, and learn from these programs!
